## Let's get the agent to place blocks!

``||agent.agent place forward||`` and ``||agent.agent move forward by 1||`` blocks, and have the agent place blocks! How far should the agent move to reach the blue block? After clicking on the “1” part, enter a number to move the agent that many blocks!

Then, if you click on the right side![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camp-minecraft/TechkidsCampTutorial/master/images/playbutton.png), the program will run!

```ghost
hiragana_agent.place(FORWARD)
hiragana_agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
```
